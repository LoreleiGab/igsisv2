Danger of Default Value

In creation of tables avoid leaving defaul value in fields definition.
If you leave it will not be required, user input is not required.
When you press enter without entering anything the default value will be stored.

A good example is the user_id field in the Customers/add.ctp which for default is thus created by the Bake.

    echo $this->Form->input('user_id', ['options' => $users]);          

Thus the first value is assumed whenever the user does not select anything in the select.

Idealy change to other value:
            echo $this->Form->input('user_id', ['empty' => true,'options' => $users]);
            
So, when you tap enter, with nothing selected will be required to select something.
