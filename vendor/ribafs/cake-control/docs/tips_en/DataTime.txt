Tips of data time

In CakePHP the fields of type date, datetime or timestamp must obligatorily use DEFAULT NULL:

birthday date DEFAULT NULL,

And we can not change your validation to require filling with notEmpty or notBlank. Otherwise
Cake does not recognize and does not add the record.

src/Template/Clientes/add.ctp ou edit.ctp

By default Cake shows only the years 2011 to 2021 in the year combo.

Let's change so that the minimum age is 13 years before the current and maximum is 100 years before the present, that is, as I am in 2016, showing 1916 to 2003, but it must be designed to meet the requirement table/application. In our case, the DNOCS, must use 18 years before, or more for the first?

With 100 years before now or more to second.

We need to know the law and use in favor of security, leaving a margin.

		echo $this->Form->input('birthday',['label' => 'Birthday',
	        'dateFormat'    => 'DMY',
	        'minYear'       => date('Y') - 100,
	        'maxYear'       => date('Y') - 13,
	        'empty'         => [
	            'day'       => 'Day',
	            'month'     => 'Month',
	            'year'      => 'Year'
            ]
        ]);
