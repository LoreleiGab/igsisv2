Tips about Databases

Tables

If a field is not important do not add to table.
But if it is important then turn it required.

Relationships

The secondary field of the relationship must be NOT NULL in the table.
user_id NOT NULL in customers.

Example
users with customers

In customers have a field user_id to relationship with users table.
In customers table the field user_id must be:

user_id int not null

Otherwise we will have problems registration of all records empty and boring relationship.

Relationships on database is more robust.
